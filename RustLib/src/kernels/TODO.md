You've correctly identified that all the kernel prototypes share a similar structure, and therefore, they all need the same set of production-hardening changes. This `bitpack.rs` file is a perfect example to use as our template.

This is a solid prototype. It correctly uses the `bitvec` crate to handle the complex bit-level manipulation. However, just like the other prototypes, it is **not production-ready.** It has the same critical flaws: it's not memory-efficient, it's not architecturally pure, and it contains `unsafe` code.

Here are the three categories of changes necessary to harden this kernel, which can then be applied to all other kernels.

### 1. Critical Need: Change Signatures for Performance (Buffer Reuse)

This is the most important change, driven by the requirements of our hardened `executor`.

*   **The Problem:** The `encode` and `decode` functions currently return a new `Vec<u8>`. This is incompatible with the `executor`'s buffer-swapping strategy and leads to excessive memory allocations.
*   **The Fix (What the dev needs to do):**
    1.  **Change the `encode` signature.** It must now accept a mutable output buffer to write to.
    2.  **Change the `decode` signature.** It must also accept a mutable output buffer.
    3.  This change will ripple down to the helper functions (`encode_slice`, `decode_slice`).

### 2. Critical Need: Decouple from FFI and Remove `unsafe`

The kernel's public API is currently acting as an FFI dispatcher, which is the wrong place for this logic.

*   **The Problem:** The `encode` and `decode` functions take raw `&[u8]` and an `original_type` string. They contain a `match` statement and an `unsafe` block to cast the bytes. This logic belongs in the FFI layer or a higher-level dispatcher, not in a pure kernel.
*   **The Fix (What the dev needs to do):**
    1.  **Make the public functions generic.** The kernel should operate on typed slices (`&[T]`), not raw bytes. The `executor` will be responsible for providing the correctly typed slice.
    2.  **Remove the `match` statement and the `unsafe` block.** The kernel should only need to know the type `T` it's operating on.


### 3. Critical Need: Decouple from `pyo3`

*   **The Problem:** The function signatures return `PyResult`. This is an FFI-specific type. Our pure kernels must not be aware of it.
*   **The Fix (What the dev needs to do):**
    Change all public function signatures to return `Result<..., PhoenixError>`, our library's internal error type. This has already been accounted for in the examples above.

### Summary of Changes for All Kernels

To bring `bitpack.rs` and all other kernels up to production standard, the dev team must:

1.  **Update all `encode`/`decode` signatures** to accept a mutable output buffer (`&mut Vec<u8>`) and return `Result<(), PhoenixError>`.
2.  **Make the public functions generic over the type `T`** instead of taking raw bytes and a type string.
3.  **Remove the `match` statement and `unsafe` blocks** from all kernels.
4.  **Update the internal helper functions**  to support the new signatures.
5.  **Rewrite the unit tests** to call the new, generic, buffer-writing APIs.

This is a significant, but highly patterned and repeatable, set of changes. Once we do it for one kernel, the template is set for all the others.
